# AI-Powered Semantic Career Recommendation Agent

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered career recommendation system** that analyzes resume content and predicts the **best-fit job role** using **semantic understanding** instead of traditional keyword matching.

The system leverages **BERT-based sentence embeddings** and **cosine similarity** to understand the meaning of resume text and compare it with predefined job role descriptions. It also performs **skill gap analysis** and provides a **personalized learning roadmap**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Most resume screening systems rely on keyword matching, which:
- Fails to capture contextual meaning
- Does not handle synonyms effectively
- Produces inaccurate role recommendations

This project addresses the problem by using **transformer-based NLP models** for semantic resume–job matching.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Semantic resume analysis using BERT embeddings  
- Best-fit job role prediction  
- Confidence-based job-fit scoring  
- Skill gap identification  
- Personalized learning roadmap recommendation  
- Explainable AI decision-making

## 🧩 Role-Based Knowledge Base
Each job role is defined with:
- A natural language job description  
- A list of required skills  
- A learning roadmap  

This role-based design improves scalability, explainability, and maintainability.

---

## 🤖 How It Works
1. Job role descriptions are converted into **semantic embeddings** using a pretrained transformer model.
2. Resume text is encoded into a semantic embedding.
3. **Cosine similarity** is computed between resume and role embeddings.
4. The role with the highest similarity score is selected.
5. Resume skills are compared with role requirements to identify skill gaps.
6. A personalized learning roadmap is generated.
